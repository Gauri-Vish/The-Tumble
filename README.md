# The-Volatility-Story

This was an Explorartory Data analysis project done for our course along with two of my teammates. 

The motivation for this project came from our recent global situations or we can say noises? that affected the stock market very drastically. This was interesting  study where in we explored the trends and also the chain reactions that led to these trends.

Plus here comes an interactive dashboard which presently takes in only the sectors and companies/Indices we chose for study.

For interesting information delve in the report!!
